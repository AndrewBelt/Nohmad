# Nohmad
Nohmad is a collection of virtual modules for VCV Rack. It is currently a work in progress, more modules will be added as time goes by.

### Noise (*WIP*)
A noise generator based on the [Quantum Rainbow 2](http://www.steadystatefate.com/quantum-rainbow-2) eurorack module by Steady State Fate. As of now, the grey and blue output still need to be implemented but the other outputs should work properly.
